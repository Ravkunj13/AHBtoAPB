 designed and verified a bridge that connects two different bus protocols, ensuring smooth communication between AHB (AMBA High-performance Bus) and AP (Application Processor). The challenge of this project was to maintain data integrity, minimize latency, and ensure efficient data transfer between the two bus systems.
üîç Key Features:
UVM Verification: Implemented UVM testbenches to validate functionality, performance, and corner cases.
RTL Design: Designed the bridge with optimal resource utilization and scalability.
Advanced Debugging: Ensured thorough debugging for seamless integration between the bus systems.
This project has enhanced my skills in digital design, RTL coding, and UVM verification, and I'm excited to take these learnings into future endeavors in the VLSI and embedded systems domain.
